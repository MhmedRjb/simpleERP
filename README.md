and i figure out what i mean with inventory system

---------
## inventory system business logic 
- Loading and unloading stock
- Transferring stock between different locations
- Generating work orders for inventory-related assignments
- Verifying and confirming these work orders
- Managing logistics, including ensuring that cars are filled efficiently to minimize transport costs.
  
**1. Loading and Unloading Stock:**

  - Create a database to store product information, including item numbers, weight, and quantity on hand.
  - Implement user interfaces for adding new stock (loading) and removing stock (unloading).
  - Validate and record all transactions in the database, updating the stock quantity (both item numbers and weight) accordingly.

**2. Transferring Stock Between Different Locations:**

- Extend the database to include location information for each item (e.g., warehouse A, warehouse B).
- Develop a user interface for transferring stock between locations.
- Ensure that the transferred quantity (both item numbers and weight) is subtracted from the source location and added to the destination location in the database.

**3. Generating Work Orders:**
  - Allow users to create work orders specifying tasks like restocking, transferring, or adjusting inventory.
  - Work orders should include details such as item numbers, weight, quantity, source, and destination (if applicable).
  - Store work orders in a database.

**4. Verifying and Confirming Work Orders:**

  - Provide an interface for authorized personnel to review and approve work orders.
  - Implement a workflow that ensures work orders are reviewed before execution.
  - Once approved, mark the work order as confirmed.

**5. Managing Logistics:**

  - Integrate algorithms to optimize logistics, such as route planning to minimize transportation costs.
  - Consider factors like vehicle capacity, fuel costs, and delivery schedules.
  - Update work orders with optimized routes and transportation details.

**6. Inventory Reconciliation:**

  - Implement regular reconciliation processes to ensure physical and recorded inventory align.
  - Generate reports highlighting any discrepancies (both in item numbers and weight) for investigation.

**7. User Authentication and Authorization:**

  - Implement user roles and permissions to ensure only authorized users can perform certain actions.
  - Differentiate between roles like administrators, warehouse managers, and regular staff.

**8. Reporting and Analytics:**

  - Develop reports to provide insights into inventory levels, transaction history (including item numbers and weight), and logistics efficiency.
  - Use data analytics to identify trends, forecast demand, and optimize stock levels.

**9. Error Handling and Logging:**

  - Implement error handling mechanisms to capture and log exceptions or issues in the system.
  - Ensure that logged errors are reviewed and addressed promptly.

**10. Security and Data Backup:**

  - Implement security measures to protect sensitive inventory data.
  - Regularly backup the database to prevent data loss.
